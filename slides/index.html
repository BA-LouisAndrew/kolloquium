            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Fraud activity is an unlawful action, where
                someone intentionally deceives other person
                or system for their own profit
              </li>
              <li>
                Fraud prevention is a serious matter, FTC
                reported 70% increase in fraud activities in
                2021, compared to 2020 (#cite)
              </li>
              <li>
                Large businesses usually are built upon
                multiple teams that have their own
                responsibility and expertise
              </li>
              <li>
                The independent teams have their own
                preferences and practices. They even might
                have a different idea on how a fraudulent
                customer might be

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The goal of this research is to establish
                collaboration between multiple autonomous
                teams in a single fraud detection process as
                efficiently as possible
              </li>
              <li>
                The system can help in transforming the
                fraud detection process to be a
                collaborative process and each team can make
                a contribution by making it more reliable as
                their knowledge increases
              </li>
              <li>
                Simplify it by encapsulating the internal
                logic while presenting the result in an
                understandable format

              <li>
                Fraud (#cite) detection techniques can be
                categorized to 2 parts, supervised and
                unsupervised
              </li>
              <li>
                Lots of researches on how to detect fraud
                better, more accurate
              </li>
              <li>
                Rule based is not the perfect method,
                difficult to manage, and the rules have to
                be adapted
              </li>
              <li>
                Rule based can be useful when there's not
                much prior knowledge on how a fraudulent
                entity might be
