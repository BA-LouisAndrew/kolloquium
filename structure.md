# Design & Implementation of a Fraud Detection System for Autonomous Teams

## Motivation
- Why am I even doing this
- What is the problem that I try to solve
- Why the problem exists in the first place

## Analysis
- Main (close to technical) goal of the project, why I chose the rule-based approach and so on
- State of the art, comparison to others, elaborate on the ML features maybe?

## Use Cases
- Show use case diagram, and user stories extracted from the diagram itself

## Architecture
- Show system and SW architecture
- Mention the "Layered Architecture" from the SW design
- Mention node, for UI it's de facto and for backend because of its non-blocking I/O operation

## Business Layer
- Show sequences, do not go into detail on ALL of it, keep it short and simple, as said by the Prof.

## Result
- Docker compose, all components can be run as Docker containers in one command
- Most configurations can be configured via environment variables (no need to touch code)
- Additional necessary features that are discovered during the implementation process is implemented
- Testing (SW built with TDD), try to test as much as possible

## Evaluation
- Go to user story table and its implementation

## Demonstration
- Demo time!

## Outlook
- Hoped that this system can establish a common ground for autonomous teams to collaborate on a fraud detection process
- Not ready to be used in a real world scenario out of the box, more improvement such as data security and GDPR needed
